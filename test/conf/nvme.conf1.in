  # End-to-end data protection. This item is only used if the namespace is formatted to use end-to-end protection information.
  # if the value is set to '1', then the protection information are generated by controller, and the logical block data and protection information are written to NVM. 
  # if the value is set to '2', then the protection information are transferred from the host buffer to NVM.
